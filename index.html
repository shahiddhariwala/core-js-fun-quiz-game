    <!-- 
    defer is Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a
     browser that the script is meant to be executed 
     after the document has been parsed,
     but before firing DOMContentLoaded.
    Scripts with the defer attribute will prevent the
     DOMContentLoaded event from firing until the script
      has loaded and finished evaluating.
    This attribute must not be used if the src attribute 
    is absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case 
    it would have no effect.
    To achieve a similar effect for dynamically 
    inserted scripts use async="false" instead. Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document. -->
